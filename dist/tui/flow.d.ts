 * keys drive them — are unit-testable.
 *
 * This models a genuine loop: the caller (App.tsx) folds the returned Step
 * back into its single `step` state slot exactly like every other
 * transition already in the guided flow, so a long interactive session
 * (sync A -> menu -> sync A again -> menu -> sync B -> menu -> quit -> ...)
 * never nests components or accumulates state — each transition just
 * replaces `step`.
